# PaperScan
## Utility that enables the comparison of two papers based on semantics to validate or invalidate originality

 ### How to use:
  similarity_threshold = 0.90
  scanner = PaperScanner()
  def papers_copied(file_loc_p1, file_loc_p2):
    if (paper.compare(file_loc_p1, file_loc_p2) >= similarity_threshold):
        return True
    return False
 
 this method checks to see if two papers are 90% semantically similar, therefore it is highly likely that they cheated.
